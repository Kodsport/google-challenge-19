\problemname{Dictionary Compression}
In the menu to the right, you are able to download an English dictionary (\texttt{dict.txt} containing a sorted list of words, one per line.
Your task is to write a program that outputs a prefix of the dictionary that is as long as possible.

\section*{Output}
Output a number of lines, each containing a word from the dictionary.
The words must form a prefix of the entire file.

\section*{Scoring}
If you print fewer than $\frac{1}{3}$ of the words, you will get 0 points.

Otherwise, assume that the fraction of the words you output is $x$. Then, you will be given $50 + 450 \cdot (x - \frac{1}{3}) \cdot \frac{3}{2}$ points.
This means that you will be given $50$ points if you print exactly $\frac{1}{3}$ of the words, with your score increasing linearly to $500$ when you print all the words.
