\problemname{Dictionary Compression}
In the menu to the right, you are able to download an English dictionary (\texttt{dict.txt}) containing a sorted list of words, one per line,
Your task is to write a program that outputs as much of this dictionary as possible.
However, the dictionary is $972\,104$ bytes in size, while your program can be at most $91\,000$ bytes!

\section*{Input}
There is no input for this problem.

\section*{Output}
Output a number of lines, each containing a word from the dictionary.
The words must form a prefix of the entire file.
That is, you must output the first $K$ words of the dictionary, for some value of $K$.

\section*{Scoring}
Assume that the fraction of the words you output is $x$. Then, you will be given $500 \cdot x$ points.

\section*{Limits}
Your program for this task can be at most \textbf{91000} bytes in length.
This limit includes files submitted along with the program.

It may be useful to know that it is possible to submit files alongside your program on Kattis --
such files can then be read from \texttt{/src/<filename>}.
